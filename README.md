You will Need Npcap for using scapy firstly. So go ahead and install it from https://npcap.com/
(Optional)Secondly if you wanna run the project in your own environment then skip this part. But if you want to create a virtual environment for running then use the following commands

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Voila! Your virtual environment is up and running.
pip install scapy psutil to install scapy
python a.py <interface> to run the program and generate the required log file
